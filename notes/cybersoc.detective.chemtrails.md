We've been rummaging through a Person of Interest's wheelie bins. We've found this boarding pass; although it looks like whoever had it was a bit paranoid that someone like us would find it.

I think we can still do something with this though... There is one thing in particular on here that may help us.

We really need to find the SEAT NUMBER of this person, in order to connect it with other evidence the team has gathered.

We've attached the boarding pass for you. Please find this out for us.

Visiting the "musicairport.com" website yields that a lot of the content requires Adobe Flash Player to function, so this is a dead end. The site is incredibly low-quality, so the fact that it's on the ticket makes me think that it's important somehow. Will look into getting access to the content more if nothing else pans out.

The "IATA" abbreviation on the ticket stands for the International Air Transport Association. The departing airport, LHR, stands for London Heathrow Airport. The destination, CDG, stands for Charles de Gaulle Airport in Paris, France.

No matching flights for that gate could be found for the date on [Dutch Plane Spotters](https://schiphol.dutchplanespotters.nl/?date=2020-02-12&group=hourarr&excludeLocals=true). I downloaded the historical data from the Heathrow airport for December of 2020 [here](http://www.lhr-lgw.co.uk/heathrow-archives-2020.html), but was unable to open the file in any meaningful way to yield any data.

Finally I decided to try the obvious, which is reading the ticket's barcode. [This site](https://online-barcode-reader.inliteresearch.com/) is able to read uploaded images' barcodes, and it yielded the following:

```
Sarah, Luxton - LHR to CDG - BA304 - SEAT NUMBER: 22B
```
