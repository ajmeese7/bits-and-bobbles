One way to do this is to use word boundaries (`\b`) instead of the `\S` anchor:

```regex
^\b[\x20-\x7E]*\b$
```

This would match your given test case `Priya@ #432`, but would not match `priya##23รก` or `Priya@ #432 `. You can see an example of this regex in action on Regex101 [here](https://regex101.com/r/bpcUmQ/1).
