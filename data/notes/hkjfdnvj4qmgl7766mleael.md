We're trying to plan when is best to break into James' house to plant a bug.

What time does he start work? (UK time).

[This tweet](https://twitter.com/jammymarkson/status/1226989808783888384) indicates that James just completed 8 hours of work. In my time zone, the tweet was posted at 1702, which converts to 2202 in UK time. This means that James starts work at 1400 UK time, or "2:00" for normal folks.
