We need to make sure James is far away when we try and break into his house.

In what city does James work?

One picture of a train station that James posted ([link](https://twitter.com/jammymarkson/status/1226997008977866753/photo/1))contains the text "Caerdydd Canolog" and "Great Western Railway". A quick internet search on the text returns a Wikipedia page of the train station in Cardiff, Wales ([link](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cardiff_Central_railway_station)). This is the same city that James works in.
