The `-m` flag is intended to take a JSON string directly instead of reading from STDIN, which is what your `echo` statement is passing.

If you want to read from `echo`, simply remove the `-m` flag entirely. If you wish to use the `-m` flag and read from a string, try the following format:

```shell
keybase chat api -m "{'method': 'send', 'params': {'options': {'channel': {'name': 'you', 'public': true}, 'message': {'body': 'Still going...'}}}}"
```
